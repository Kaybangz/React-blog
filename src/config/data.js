    category: 'sports',
    subCategory: ['Russian attack', 'sports', 'Breaking news'],
    description:
      "FC Schalke 04, a professional German soccer club, is removing the patch of a Russian majority state-owned energy company after Vladimir Putin's armed forces invaded Ukraine, a sovereign nation. Following recent developments, FC Schalke 04 have decided to remove the logo of main sponsor GAZPROM from the club's shirts, the club announced in a statement. It will be replaced by lettering reading 'Schalke 04' instead. Gazprom -- the largest natural gas company in the world -- is the club's biggest sponsor ... and the company name is prominently displayed across the player's chests on their jerseys. Of course, after weeks of increased tensions, Russia invaded Ukraine, launching a full-fledged attack against the country. Dozens of people have already reportedly died. FC Schalke 04 wasn't alone in working with the powerful energy company. UEFA, the governing body that oversees European soccer, also has a business relationship with Gazprom. Unlike FC Schalke 04, UEFA hasn't opted (at least not yet) to cut ties with the company ... though they did release a statement condemning the attacks. UEFA shares the international community's significant concern for the security situation developing in Europe and strongly condemns the ongoing Russian military invasion of Ukraine. That's not to say the soccer body hasn't taken any action against Russia. The country was scheduled to host the Champions League final in Spring, but UEFA decided to pull the game. They haven't yet named a replacement city. With no end in sight for Putin's invasion, expect to see more players, teams and leagues unaffiliate themselves with Russia.",

    title: 'Kanye "Ye" West Files Official Response After Kim Kardashian Requests to Be Legally Single',
    category: 'Entertainment',

    description:
      "Kanye 'Ye' West is making legal moves in his ongoing divorce from Kim Kardashian. According to court documents obtained by E! News, the 44-year-old rapper has filed an opposition to his estranged wife's request for bifurcation, in which she asks the court to declare her legally single as she continues to work on a divorce settlement. In the documents, a lawyer for Ye states that 'Kims motion should be denied without prejudice so that Kim can refile it with the mandatory corrections and requested conditions set forth in the proposed judgment. Alternatively, a hearing regarding these additional conditions should be set.' E! News has reached out to Kim's legal team and has not heard back. The legal development comes nearly year after Kim, 41, first filed for divorce. In documents submitted on Feb. 19, 2021, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians alum cited 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for the split and requested joint legal and physical custody of her four children with Ye: North, 8, Saint, 6, Chicago, 4, and Psalm, 2. In December, Kim's legal team filed paperwork asking the court for her marital status to be dissolved given that the SKIMS mogul 'has no desire to reconcile' with Ye.'Irreconcilable differences have led to the irremediable breakdown of the marriage, and there is no possibility of saving the marriage through counseling or other means,' read the documents, which were obtained by E! News. 'The continued maintenance of technical marital status between [Kim] and [Ye] serves no useful purpose, and there is no reason to maintain the legal relationship.' The filing further claimed that Ye had been 'been non-responsive' to Kim's attempts to 'move this case forward to a speedy and amicable resolution.' The filing also stated that Kim will agree to 'any conditions' the court wishes to impose in order to divorce her ex. For her part, Kim has moved on romantically since splitting with Ye. She has been dating Pete Davidson since November, with a source recently telling E! News that members of the Kardashian family 'love this new relationship for Kim.' 'Pete is getting close with Kim's family and they really like him,'' an insider said. 'They just want Kim to be happy and he has made her very happy.' As for Ye, he has been vocal about wanting to reconcile with Kim, including publicly asking her to 'run right back' to him and seemingly sending the star a truckload of roses on Valentine's Day. In an interview with Hollywood Unlocked in January, Ye confirmed that he had bought a house across the street from Kim's Hidden Hills home so that he could be close to their kids.'My solace comes from seeing my kids and getting a solid schedule,' he said. 'That's why I even got the house'.",

      "A group of Ukrainian border guards' final words are now preserved on audio -- as they faced death from Russian sailors ... they simply told the Russians to f**k off. According to an audio recording, 13 Ukrainian soldiers who were killed Thursday while defending Zmiinyi -- or Snake Island -- gave a powerful final message as the Russian aggressors on a warship threatened to open fire. The Russians got on a loudspeaker and demanded the Ukrainians surrender or else. In the tense moments that followed you can hear the Ukrainian guards discussing how they should respond. One of the guards said, 'Should I tell them to go f**k themselves?' ... and then uttered it over the radio. The Russians followed through and bombed the location killing all the soldiers stationed there. Snake Island is located off the country’s southeastern shoreline, and had been approached by 2 Russian vessels after President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion. Russia ended up assaulting the 42-acre island from the warship, and also deployed an air attack. Ukraine is reporting nearly 150 deaths and more than 300 injured after the first day of war.",

      "UEFA will no longer stage this season's Champions League final in St. Petersburg after Russia attacked Ukraine, The Associated Press has learned. An extraordinary meeting of the UEFA executive committee will be held at 0900 GMT on Friday to discuss the crisis and where officials are likely to confirm whether the 2022 Champions League final on Saturday, May 28 should still be held at the Gazprom Arena in St. Petersburg, Russia, a source told the AP.'Following the evolution of the situation between Russia and Ukraine in the last 24 hours, the UEFA president has decided to call an extraordinary meeting of the executive committee .... in order to evaluate the situation and take all necessary decisions,' UEFA said in a statement confirming the meeting.The European Parliament, British government and fan groups had asked UEFA to reverse their decision to play the showpiece of Europe's premier club competition in Russian city St. Petersburg, where the stadium is sponsored by Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom. 'On this tragic day, our thoughts are with everyone in Ukraine, our friends, colleagues, members, & their loved ones,” the Fans Supporters Europe group tweeted on Thursday. “Given the events unfolding, we expect an imminent announcement from UEFA on the relocation of the Champions League final.” The Ukrainian Premier League suspended operations on Thursday due to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's decision to impose martial law. The league has been on a two-month winter break and was due to resume on Friday. It did not give any planned date to restart. The International Paralympic Committee said it was in talks with sports officials in Ukraine and Russia as their teams prepare to head to China for the start of the Paralympic Games next week. “The IPC is in dialogue with both the Ukrainian and Russian Paralympic Committees ahead of the Beijing 2022 Paralympic Winter Games,” the IPC said in an emailed statement. “As a politically neutral organisation, the IPC’s focus remains on the upcoming Games rather than the ongoing situation.” Russia's name, flag and anthem are already barred from the March 4-13 Paralympics in Beijing over previous doping disputes. Its team is due to compete as RPC, short for Russian Paralympic Committee.",

    title: '5 trending open source machine learning JavaScript frameworks',
    category: 'Programming',
    subCategory: ['Tech', 'Javascript', 'AI and Machine Learning'],
    description:
      "The tremendous growth of the machine learning field has been driven by the availability of open source tools that allow developers to build applications easily. (For example, AndreyBu, who is from Germany and has more than five years of experience in machine learning, has been utilizing various open source frameworks to build captivating machine learning projects.) Although the Python programming language powers most of the machine learning frameworks, JavaScript hasn’t been left behind. JavaScript developers have been using various frameworks for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser. Here are the five trending open source machine learning frameworks in JavaScript. 1. TensorFlow.jsTensorFlow.js is an open source library that allows you to run machine learning programs completely in the browser. It is the successor of Deeplearn.js, which is no longer supported. TensorFlow.js improves on the functionalities of Deeplearn.js and empowers you to make the most of the browser for a deeper machine learning experience. With the library, you can use versatile and intuitive APIs to define, train, and deploy models from scratch right in the browser. Furthermore, it automatically offers support for WebGL and Node.js. If you have pre-existing trained models you want to import to the browser, TensorFlow.js will allow you do that. You can also retrain existing models without leaving the browser. 2. Machine learning toolsThe machine learning tools library is a compilation of resourceful open source tools for supporting widespread machine learning functionalities in the browser. The tools provide support for several machine learning algorithms, including unsupervised learning, supervised learning, data processing, artificial neural networks (ANN), math, and regression. If you are coming from a Python background and looking for something similar to Scikit-learn for JavaScript in-browser machine learning, this suite of tools could have you covered. 3. Keras.js Keras.js is another trending open source framework that allows you to run machine learning models in the browser. It offers GPU mode support using WebGL. If you have models in Node.js, you’ll run them only in CPU mode. Keras.js also offers support for models trained using any backend framework, such as the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK). Some of the Keras models that can be deployed on the client-side browser include Inception v3 (trained on ImageNet), 50-layer Residual Network (trained on ImageNet), and Convolutional variational auto-encoder (trained on MNIST). 4. Brain.js Machine learning concepts are very math-heavy, which may discourage people from starting. The technicalities and jargons in this field may make beginners freak out. This is where Brain.js becomes important. It is an open source, JavaScript-powered framework that simplifies the process of defining, training, and running neural networks. If you are a JavaScript developer who is completely new to machine learning, Brain.js could reduce your learning curve. It can be used with Node.js or in the client-side browser for training machine learning models. Some of the networks that Brain.js supports include feed-forward networks, Ellman networks, and Gated Recurrent Units networks.5. STDLib STDLib is an open source library for powering JavaScript and Node.js applications. If you are looking for a library that emphasizes in-browser support for scientific and numerical web-based machine learning applications, STDLib could suit your needs.  The library comes with comprehensive and advanced mathematical and statistical functions to assist you in building high-performing machine learning models. You can also use its expansive utilities for building applications and other libraries. Furthermore, if you want a framework for data visualization and exploratory data analysis, you’ll find STDLib worthwhile. Conclusion If you are a JavaScript developer who intends to delve into the exciting world of machine learning or a machine learning expert who intends to start using JavaScript, the above open source frameworks will intrigue you.",

    description:
      "A Nova Scotia teenager has bounced his way to a Guinness World Record by solving more than 200 Rubik’s cubes while on a pogo stick. Saul Hafting, a 16-year-old from Annapolis Royal, which is about two hours outside of Halifax, smashed the record back in October by completing 211 cubes in an hour and 12 minutes, but only learned this week that his attempt was successful. He told Global News Morning he first became interested in the cube-shaped puzzles six years ago, when a friend showed him how to solve one while on a camping trip. “I was absolutely mind-blown. I couldn’t comprehend that someone could solve a Rubik’s cube in like under a minute,” Hafting said. Once he got back from the trip, he went to Walmart and got his own Rubik’s cube. “After that I would do it like all day every day for like six years,” he said. “So here we are.” Hafting said he’s held a lifelong interest in Guinness World Records and always knew he wanted to break one. “But so many of those records are so crazy difficult to get, I didn’t think that I would ever be on a level where it would be possible for me to get a record,” he said. “I knew that if I could incorporate Rubik’s cubes with something, I might be on that level where I could maybe break one.” Initially, he tried to break the world record for completing a Rubik’s cube in the fastest time. He said he did manage to break that one, “but then some other guy broke it before mine was official, so then this was the second try.” Hafting, who taught himself how to pogo stick, trained for this record over the course of about three months — first by jumping on a pogo stick for as long as he could and later incorporating the Rubik’s cube. “I would bounce on a pogo stick as long as I could, as many days of the week I could,” he said. “So (at first) I would bounce on it for 10 minutes, and that’s all I could do, and then I bounce on it the next day for a little longer.” At one point, after he worked his way up to being able to stay on the pogo stick for 45 minutes, he developed blisters on his knees from where he was holding the pogo stick. During his Guinness World Record attempt, he wore long pants with knee pads underneath to protect his legs from chafing. Hafting says he doesn’t plan to break any other world records any time soon, but, “if this one gets broken, I’ll be getting it back.”",

Recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its “ideal embodiment of a medieval city” Siena is a moody and mysterious, medieval town. Tightly packed, narrow, lanes are penned in by towering houses such that barely a ray of light glances the cobbled streets. On a cloudy day, old streetlights peer out of the mist illuminating orange walls and red brick buildings that have seen their fair share of history. Piazza del Campo is one of the finest squares in Europe and home to the famous Palio horse race. Torre Mangia (tower) offers grand views over the red-tiled rooftops, and the Siena Duomo not only has a beautiful façade surrounded by white and black gothic towers but its interior is lavishly decorated. GETTING TO SIENA ON A DAY TRIP FROM FLORENCE Direct trains take 1 hour 15 minutes and leave from Florence Santa Maria Novella train station. Alternatively, join a day tour to Siena that also visits San Gimignano. For more information on how to visit read our guide to spending one day in Siena. 02 – SAN GIMIGNANO San Gimignano is a medieval hilltop town with towers that rise above green fields and pointy cypresses. It is the Manhattan of the Middle Ages that radiates under the Tuscan sun. At one time there were over 70 towers in San Gimignano, today only 14 remain. But what’s left behind is a well-preserved medieval hill town where one can easily picture knights clipping up and down cobbled lanes on horseback as they navigate the main square. For a small medieval hilltop town, there’s a surprising number of things to do in San Gimignano. The Duomo is ornately decorated with frescoes telling stories that are not quite told the same anywhere else. Climbing up the towers is rewarded with sweeping views over the town and countryside. And don’t miss San Gimignano’s contemporary art scene. Known for its Vernaccia wine, golden ham and local saffron, San Gimignano is one of the best Florence day trips. GETTING TO SAN GIMIGNANO ON A DAY TRIP FROM FLORENCE San Gimignano is a 1-hour drive from Florence. If you are travelling via public transport, regular buses connect Florence to San Gimignano with a stop in Poggibonsi. All the details are in our guide to visiting San Gimignano for a day. 03 – CHIANTI REGION The Chianti region is just south of Florence. Known for its squat bottle in straw baskets, wine has been made here for over 700 years. There are few finer pleasures in Tuscany than sharing a traditional Tuscan lunch of sliced prosciutto and local cheeses with a bottle of Chianti surrounded by rows of twisty vines. The main towns of Chianti are Castellina, Radda and Greve but we have a soft spot for Badia a Passignano. This tiny village has an abbey and three great restaurants all set overlooking a vast sweep of wine and olive groves. It’s the perfect destination for wine lovers and a great option for a day trip from Florence. The vineyards belong to the Antinori estate who have built a fancy modern home, easily accessible just off the motorway between Florence and Siena. Finished in 2012, Antinori provides wine tasting and cellar tours in their grand design building. Booking in advance is required. GETTING TO THE CHIANTI REGION ON A DAY TRIP FROM FLORENCE The villages and vineyards of Chianti are close to Florence but, they are dotted about the countryside so the best way to visit them is in a hire car. This way you could visit Antinori estate, Badia a Passignano and Greve al Chianti all in one day. 04 – VAL D’ORCIA In Val D’Orcia, cypress trees wind up sinuous roads to grand villas sat above rolling hills. The most scenic of valleys in Tuscany, it’s packed with photographic opportunities and gorgeous villages that have made this beautiful part of Italy a UNESCO World Heritage site. Brunello is a single grape Sangiovese wine, only harvested from vines grown on the hills of Montalcino – a small village that’s a delight to stroll around. Nearby Pienza is often considered the ‘ideal city of the Renaissance.’ This is one of the best regions in Italy for experiencing local wineries in a beautiful setting. Another 15 kilometres past Pienza, Montepulciano is an interesting walled town with winding medieval streets on top of a rocky cliff face. The central square is surrounded by imposing facades and terraces that look out over miles of sweeping Tuscan countryside. GETTING TO VAL D’ORCIA FROM FLORENCE Seeing all the sights by public transport is hard, so the best way to see Val d’Orcia from Florence is by joining a tour. This tour visits Pienza & Montepulciano and includes wine-tasting. Another great option is to hire a car and spend 2 days exploring the area.",

      "Russian troops advanced toward Ukraine's capital early Saturday and street fighting broke out as city officials urged residents to take shelter. Smoke and flames could be seen rising over Kyiv, but as dawn broke it was not immediately clear how far the soldiers had advanced and Ukrainian officials reported some success in fending off assaults.  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had not left the city in a video recorded in a downtown street, adding that claims that the Ukrainian military would put down arms were false.\n  'We aren't going to lay down weapons. We will protect the country,' he said. It came after President Joe Biden on Friday signed an order authorizing up to $600 million for military assistance to Ukraine under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Kyiv woke Saturday after a night of explosions and gun battles in the streets to find the Ukrainian government was still in control of the capital, vowing not to lay down its arms against the Russian assault. The Kremlin's unprovoked attack on its democratic neighbor has drawn widespread condemnation and left Russian President Vladimir Putin facing pariah status on the global stage. Tens of thousands have fled the Russian advance, and those who stayed are enduring an assault that Ukraine and international watchdogs said was increasingly hitting civilians. While many Kyiv residents spent the night huddled in underground shelters, others have taken up arms and made Molotov cocktails to help their army's desperate but stern resistance against Putin's invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has refused to leave the capital despite saying he believes he is the number one target of the Russian attack. Instead he has been posting videos from the streets, urging his people to join him in defiance. Amid shelling and explosions, two baby boys were born in a bomb shelter in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson Friday, Ukraine's health minister said. 'Life goes on, we give birth to children and no one can beat us!' Oleh Liashko wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday, adding that he was 'incredibly proud of our doctors.' Liashko said that his ministry was 'doing what is possible and impossible to ensure that hospitals have everything they need'. 'I never thought I would look for bulletproof vests for doctors,' he added. ",
